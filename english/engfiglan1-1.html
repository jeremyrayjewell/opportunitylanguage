        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Figurative language is a way of expressing ideas or thoughts through the use of language 
          that is not meant to be taken literally. It is a literary device that can be used to add 
          depth, color, and emotion to writing or speech. Figurative language can take many forms, 
          including similes, metaphors, personification, and idioms.</br></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Figurative language can help to convey complex ideas more vividly and make writing and 
          speech more engaging and memorable. However, it is important to use it appropriately and 
          not overuse it, as it can become confusing or distracting if used excessively.</p>

            <p class="caption">“It’s raining cats and dogs!” is an example of an idiom. Pets do not actually</br> 
              fall from clouds in the sky. It just means it is raining heavily.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;An idiom is a phrase or expression that has a figurative meaning that is different 
              from the literal meaning of the individual words. Idioms are a type of figurative language that 
              can add color and interest to writing or speech, but they can be difficult to understand if you 
              are not familiar with them.</p>
        </div>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the idiom "break a leg" is commonly used to wish someone luck before a 
          performance, but the literal meaning of the words does not convey this sentiment. Instead, the phrase 
          is believed to have originated as a way for actors to wish each other luck without actually saying 
          the words "good luck," which was considered bad luck in the theater.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Idioms are an important part of many languages and can add richness and depth to 
          communication, but it is important to understand their meanings in order to use them 
          appropriately.</p>
