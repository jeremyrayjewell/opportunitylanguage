              Figurative language is a way of expressing ideas or thoughts
              through the use of language that is not meant to be taken
              literally. It is a literary device that can be used to add depth,
              color, and emotion to writing or speech. Figurative language can
              take many forms, including similes, metaphors, personification,
              and idioms.

              Figurative language can help to convey complex ideas more vividly
              and make writing and speech more engaging and memorable. However,
              it is important to use it appropriately and not overuse it, as it
              can become confusing or distracting if used excessively.

              An idiom is a phrase or expression that has a figurative meaning
              that is different from the literal meaning of the individual
              words. Idioms are a type of figurative language that can add color
              and interest to writing or speech, but they can be difficult to
              understand if you are not familiar with them.

              For example, the idiom "break a leg" is commonly used to wish
              someone luck before a performance, but the literal meaning of the
              words does not convey this sentiment. Instead, the phrase is
              believed to have originated as a way for actors to wish each other
              luck without actually saying the words "good luck," which was
              considered bad luck in the theater.
            </p>
            <p class="figurative-language-is">
              Idioms are an important part of many languages and can add
              richness and depth to communication, but it is important to
              understand their meanings in order to use them appropriately.
