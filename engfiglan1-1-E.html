            <p>Justine was about to take on the role of a lifetime in the local theater production. She had been rehearsing tirelessly for weeks, and tonight was the big night. Her friends gathered backstage to wish her luck before the curtains rose. "<button id="blank1" class="blank-button" data-answer=""></button> tonight, Justine! I know you'll do great in the play," they cheered, their faces filled with excitement.</p>

            <p>As Justine prepared to go on stage, she couldn't help but think about the acting course she had just spent months completing. She learned a lot, but it <button id="blank2" class="blank-button" data-answer=""></button>. Justine received financial assistance for it, but the price still seemed outrageous. Still, she felt as though she needed to <button id="blank3" class="blank-button" data-answer=""></button> in her career, which had stalled since she graduated. She hoped it was worth it. She would find out soon enough. The play was about to begin, and Justine had a leading role to perform. This was no time to panic and <button id="blank4" class="blank-button" data-answer=""></button>, to freeze and forget her lines. As she stood in the spotlight, she reassured herself that this performance was going to be <button id="blank5" class="blank-button" data-answer=""></button> compared to the weeks of grueling rehearsals.</p>

            <p>After the show, her friends would gather around her, eager to hear how it went. They would want to know behind-the-scenes secrets. Would Justine <button id="blank6" class="blank-button" data-answer=""></button>, and tell them that the director had already told her she was being considered for another role? Maybe it was too soon. Her father would become too excited, and try to <button id="blank7" class="blank-button" data-answer=""></button> to help her prepare… but that wouldn’t be good for him right now with his health problems. Her friend Catherine would probably say she was lying just so she could <button id="blank8" class="blank-button" data-answer=""></button>, or maybe jealous Susan would try to <button id="blank9" class="blank-button" data-answer=""></button> and ruin it for her. They might both tell her she was <button id="blank10" class="blank-button" data-answer=""></button>, and that she ought to stick to just simple roles for now. Theater people can be very superstitious, and Justine was no exception. As the curtains rose, she decided she wouldn’t say anything to anyone about her expectations.</p>
